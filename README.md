# Plaid Puma poker project

A little coding skills refresher project for myself.

Modeling the basics of poker because it's a game with clearly defined rules but not so simple that it can be completely solved in an afternoon.

Basic goals: remember how Java and GitHub and IDEs and test frameworks and blah blah blah work at all. Then set up a basic representation of cards and the rules of the game.

First real goal: be able to calculate winning probabilities for various Texas Hold 'Em starting hand matchups. For example, input "QQ" and "AK" and the program would say "QQ 57% AK 43%" 

Second real goal (distant future): be able to play against the computer

Additional goals
- make this an Android app to get some mobile experience
- attach some kind of note-taking functionality
